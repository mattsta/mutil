    """A rapid lookup dual-layer cache.

    Goal: cache everything locally in memory while maintaining a persistent disk cache,
          but use the in-memory cache for all reads, but save writes to the disk cache
          so we can easily reload the entire previously saved cache on startup again.

    Why do we bother with this?

    We like using diskcache for persistence, but a diskcache lookup is 4-5 Âµs while a
    python dict in-memory lookup is 30 ns (15x faster).
