class RateLimit:
    """Provides a coroutine to `await` which will block if
    called more than 'rate' times in 'bucket_seconds' seconds.

    Accuracy for rate limit intervals is the accuracy of time.monotonic()
    (typically nanosecond accuracy).

    NOTE: We use a queue of each requested timestamp to figure out
          the sliding windows for when requests can resume again.

          So if you set your rate to 20 million per second, we'll store
          20 million timestamps.

          Under normal conditions your rate limits will be like 90 in 15 minutes
          or 1 per second or 300 per 5 minutes, etc, so the memory used by
          the timestamps in the queue won't be overwhelming.


    Example of rate limit 1 print every 5 seconds:
    rl = RateLimit(1, 5)
    while True:
        await rl.guard()
        print("A log line, once every 5 seconds...")
